I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil. I received my B.S., M.S. and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the Federal University of Minas Gerais, in 2005, 2008 and 2013 respectively. I was also a visiting researcher at the Sailing Lab of the Carnegie Mellon University in 2015.

My research interests include Machine Learning and Recommender Systems. I am working on interpretability of machine learning models via causal reasoning.
